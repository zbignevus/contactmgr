# Contact List Manager
My first single-page app built with AngularJS, Bootstrap(also as an AngularStrap library) and Firebase- a simple contact list manager allowing full CRUD abilities. 



You can view the available list of contacts on the "Browse" page. To sort out the list by column, press on the column name.
By clicking "View" you can view the individual contact's profile. To remove the contact, press "Delete".
To edit the contact's data, select the contact from the list and once you are on his profile page, click on any of the requested field inputs.
To add a new contact, simply navigate to the "Add Contact" page, fill in the form and press "Add Contact".
